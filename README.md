# Neural Networks Term Project on the Prediction of Trajectories for the Dimensionally Reduced Three Body Problem

The code base will be difficult to navigate.

The code used for the biggest part of the project can be found in /data_generation/. Don't let the name of the folder fool you, here you can find everything from generating the training data (three_body_data_generator.py) to running machine learning experiments (experiment_#.ipynb), to validation, testing and generating figures.

As we're not graded on the code, I hope this will suffice for proof-of-work.
